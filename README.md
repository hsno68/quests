# quests
Hello! Welcome to my first project!

In this project, I aim to practice my beginner HTML skills by creating
a simple website on cooking recipes. However, I do not find a recipes
page relatable as I rarely cook. Instead, my project will be on how to
complete quests in the online game Old School RuneScape. I chose to
create my website based on quests because I find a lot of similarities
between cooking a dish and completing a quest; both require starting
ingredients and materials, and both require the cook or player to
follow a specific set of instructions to achieve a goal.
