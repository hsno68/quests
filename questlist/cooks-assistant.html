    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The Lumbridge Castle Cook is in a mess. Today is the Duke of Lumbridge's birthday and the Cook is in charge of baking him a birthday cake. However, the Cook needs a lot of ingredients but he has forgotten to buy <em>any</em> of them; he'll never get them in time now. What is he going to do? Will you, the adventurer, help him in his predicament?</p>
    <h2>Required Items</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Egg</li>
      <li>Bucket of milk</li>
      <li>Pot of flour</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h3>Starting out</h3>
    <p>Begin the quest by speaking to the Cook in the Lumbridge Castle Kitchen. A bucket is available in the cellar of Lumbridge Castle, and a pot in the kitchen where you begin; be sure to grab these as they are nearby and you will need them later to obtain your ingredients.</p>
    <h3>Egg</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Go east out of Lumbridge Castle.</li>
      <li>Run north along the path until you reach the chicken coop north-west of Farmer Fred's house.</li>
      <li>Go into the chicken coop and pick up an egg from the ground.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Bucket of milk</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>From the chicken coop, with an empty bucket, go north into the cow pasture.</li>
      <li>Use the empty bucket on the dairy cow to obtain a bucket of milk.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Pot of flour</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Leave the cow pasture, with an empty pot, and go south-west to the wheat field.</li>
      <li>Pick up a bundle of grain.</li>
      <li>Leave the wheat field and enter the nearby Mill Lane Mill to the north-east.
        <ul>
          <li>Optional: You may talk to Millie Miller inside the mill for an explanation on how to make flour.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Climb up the ladder to the top floor.</li>
      <li>Put the grain in the hopper.</li>
      <li>Pull the lever.</li>
      <li>Climb back down the ladder to the 1st floor.</li>
      <li>Using your empty pot, collect the flour from the flour bin to obtain a pot of flour.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Delivery</h3>
    <p>After collecting all three ingredients, return to Lumbridge Castle by following the path south-east of the mill and speak to the Cook in the kitchen to deliver them.</p>
